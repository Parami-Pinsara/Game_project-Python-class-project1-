This is a small developed project for a game. 


## Gambling with Python

The card decks are the most popular gambling tool in the world, yet occasionally card decks are replaced by
dices. Today we are going to create a dice game. You can choose a catchy name for this game.

#### Game Description:

##### Game Tools

There are 3 dices in this game. Each side of the first dice is labeled from 1 to 6, and each side
of the second dice is labeled with the names of 6 cities using city codes;

- CMB -Colombo]
- TYK -Tokyo
- NY - New York
- LON - London
- ATN – Athens
- SYN – Sydney

The third one has true and false values only. When you roll the dice, if one side is marked as
TRUE, the opposite side should be marked as FALSE.

#### Game Instructions:

Every player has 3 rounds, each round player should roll 3 dices at once. Let’s assume you are
the first player; and these are the results you got:

i (1, LON, TRUE)
ii (5, SYN, FALSE)
iii (6, LON, TRUE)

First dice gives a score, third dice sets positive or negative value to the first dice result.
Round Result meaing of the result

- 1st round (1, LON, TRUE) you have earned +1 at LON
- 2nd round (5, SYN, FALSE) you have earned -5 at SYN
- 3rd round (6, LON,TRUE) you have earned +6 at LON

if your total score is +2, then your city scores are LON = +7, SYN = -5
Winner

After everyone completes the game, the player who has the maximum total score wins.Think
you have 3 Players and write a python simulation. You can add any kind of python modules as
needed.
